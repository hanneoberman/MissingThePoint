# Missing The Point

## Intro

- Missing data has to be accomodated, usually filled in

- Filling in is algorithmic, which relies on convergence

- Diagnosing convergence is difficult, both visually and diagnostically

- In this paper we explore diagnostic methods for MICE, and show which parameter has the best performance

## Identifying non-convergence

- What does non-convergence look like? What are the consequences?

- 

## Simulation

- 3x3 missingness conditions: MCAR, MAR, MNAR + 5, 50, 95% of cases incomplete

- outcomes: estimated regression coefficient, CIW, coverage, R2

- convergence parameters: chain means, chain variances, scientific parameter, lambda

- diagnostics: rhat, ac
