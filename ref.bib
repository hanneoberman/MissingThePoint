We formulate these methods in terms of sequential regression multivariate imputation, which is an iterative procedure in which the missing values of each variable are randomly imputed conditionally on all the other variables in the completed data matrix. We also consider a recalibration procedure for sequential regression imputations. We apply these methods to the 2002 environmental sustainability index, which is a linear aggregation of 64 environmental variables on 142 countries.},

  abstract = {The goal of this article is to construct doubly robust (DR) estimators in ignorable missing data and causal inference models. In a missing data model, an estimator is DR if it remains consistent when either (but not necessarily both) a model for the missingness mechanism or a model for the distribution of the complete data is correctly specified. Because with observational data one can never be sure that either a missingness model or a complete data model is correct, perhaps the best that can be hoped for is to find a DR estimator. DR estimators, in contrast to standard likelihood-based or (nonaugmented) inverse probability-weighted estimators, give the analyst two chances, instead of only one, to make a valid inference. In a causal inference model, an estimator is DR if it remains consistent when either a model for the treatment assignment mechanism or a model for the distribution of the counterfactual data is correctly specified. Because with observational data one can never be sure that a model for the treatment assignment mechanism or a model for the counterfactual data is correct, inference based on DR estimators should improve upon previous approaches. Indeed, we present the results of simulation studies which demonstrate that the finite sample performance of DR estimators is as impressive as theory would predict. The proposed method is applied to a cardiovascular clinical trial.},

  abstract = {Missing covariate data commonly occur in epidemiological and clinical research, and are often dealt with using multiple imputation. Imputation of partially observed covariates is complicated if the substantive model is non-linear (e.g. Cox proportional hazards model), or contains non-linear (e.g. squared) or interaction terms, and standard software implementations of multiple imputation may impute covariates from models that are incompatible with such substantive models. We show how imputation by fully conditional specification, a popular approach for performing multiple imputation, can be modified so that covariates are imputed from models which are compatible with the substantive model. We investigate through simulation the performance of this proposal, and compare it with existing approaches. Simulation results suggest our proposal gives consistent estimates for a range of common substantive models, including models which contain non-linear covariate effects or interactions, provided data are missing at random and the assumed imputation models are correctly specified and mutually compatible. Stata software implementing the approach is freely available.},

  abstract = {Multiple imputation has become a popular approach for analyzing incomplete data. Many software packages are available to multiply impute the missing values and to analyze the resulting completed data sets. However, diagnostic tools to check the validity of the imputations are limited, and the majority of the currently available methods need considerable knowledge of the imputation model. In many practical settings, however, the imputer and the analyst may be different individuals or from different organizations, and the analyst model may or may not be congenial to the model used by the imputer. This article develops and evaluates a set of graphical and numerical diagnostic tools for two practical purposes: (i) for an analyst to determine whether the imputations are reasonable under his/her model assumptions without actually knowing the imputation model assumptions; and (ii) for an imputer to fine tune the imputation model by checking the key characteristics of the observed and imputed values. The tools are based on the numerical and graphical comparisons of the distributions of the observed and imputed values conditional on the propensity of response. The methodology is illustrated using simulated data sets created under a variety of scenarios. The examples focus on continuous and binary variables, but the principles can be used to extend methods for other types of variables. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Although this problem must arise in most reported economic evaluations containing patient-level data, it is rare for authors to detail how the problem was overcome. Statistical packages may default to handling missing data through a so-called ‘complete case analysis’, while some recent cost-analyses have appeared to favour an ‘available case’ approach. Both of these methods are problematic: complete case analysis is inefficient and is likely to be biased; available case analysis, by employing different numbers of observations for each resource use item, generates severe problems for standard statistical inference. Instead we explore imputation methods for generating ‘replacement’ values for missing data that will permit complete case analysis using the whole data set and we illustrate these methods using two data sets that had incomplete resource use information.

  abstract = {In this article we discuss the problem of assessing the performance of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms on the basis of simulation output. In essence, we extend the original ideas of Gelman and Rubin and, more recently, Brooks and Gelman, to problems where we are able to split the variation inherent within the MCMC simulation output into two distinct groups. We show how such a diagnostic may be useful in assessing the performance of MCMC samplers addressing model choice problems, such as the reversible jump MCMC algorithm. In the model choice context, we show how the reversible jump MCMC simulation output for parameters that retain a coherent interpretation throughout the simulation, can be used to assess convergence. By considering various decompositions of the sampling variance of this parameter, we can assess the performance of our MCMC sampler in terms of its mixing properties both within and between models and we illustrate our approach in both the graphical Gaussian models and normal mixtures context. Finally, we provide an example of the application of our diagnostic to the assessment of the influence of different starting values on MCMC simulation output, thereby illustrating the wider utility of our method beyond the Bayesian model choice and reversible jump MCMC context.}

The theoretical weakness of this approach is that the specified conditional densities can be incompatible, and therefore the stationary distribution to which the Gibbs sampler attempts to converge may not exist. This study investigates practical consequences of this problem by means of simulation. Missing data are created under four different missing data mechanisms. Attention is given to the statistical behavior under compatible and incompatible models. The results indicate that multiple imputation produces essentially unbiased estimates with appropriate coverage in the simple cases investigated, even for the incompatible models. Of particular interest is that these results were produced using only five Gibbs iterations starting from a simple draw from observed marginal distributions. It thus appears that, despite the theoretical weaknesses, the actual performance of conditional model specification for multivariate imputation can be quite good, and therefore deserves further study.},

In particular, existing imputation schemes differ in their ability to handle random slopes, categorical variables, differential relations at level-1 and level-2, and incomplete level-2 variables. Given the limitations of existing imputation tools, the purpose of this manuscript is to describe a flexible imputation approach that can accommodate a diverse set of two-level analysis problems that includes any of the aforementioned features. The procedure employs a fully conditional specification (also known as chained equations) approach with a latent variable formulation for handling incomplete categorical variables. Computer simulations suggest that the proposed procedure works quite well, with trivial biases in most cases.

  abstract = {Missing data are a common problem in organizational research. Missing data can occur due to attrition in a longitudinal study or nonresponse to questionnaire items in a laboratory or field setting. Improper treatments of missing data (e.g., listwise deletion, mean imputation) can lead to biased statistical inference using complete case analysis statistical techniques. This article presents a simulation and data analysis case study using a method for dealing with missing data, multiple imputation, that allows for valid statistical inference with complete case statistical analysis. Software for implementing multiple imputation under a multivariate normal model is freely and widely available (e.g., NORM, SAS, SOLAS). It should be routinely considered for imputing missing data. The authors illustrate the application of this technique using data from the HomeNet project.},

Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

  abstract = {In a family study of breast cancer, epidemiologists in Southern California increase the power for detecting a gene-environment interaction. In Gambia, a study helps a vaccination program reduce the incidence of Hepatitis B carriage. Archaeologists in Austria place a Bronze Age site in its true temporal location on the calendar scale. And in France, researchers map a rare disease with relatively little variation.Each of these studies applied Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to produce more accurate and inclusive results. General state-space Markov chain theory has seen several developments that have made it both more accessible and more powerful to the general statistician. Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice introduces MCMC methods and their applications, providing some theoretical background as well. The authors are researchers who have made key contributions in the recent development of MCMC methodology and its application. Considering the broad audience, the editors emphasize practice rather than theory, keeping the technical content to a minimum. The examples range from the simplest application, Gibbs sampling, to more complex applications. The first chapter contains enough information to allow the reader to start applying MCMC in a basic way. The following chapters cover main issues, important concepts and results, techniques for implementing MCMC, improving its performance, assessing model adequacy, choosing between models, and applications and their domains.Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice is a thorough, clear introduction to the methodology and applications of this simple idea with enormous potential. It shows the importance of MCMC in real applications, such as archaeology, astronomy, biostatistics, genetics, epidemiology, and image analysis, and provides an excellent base for MCMC to be applied to other fields as well.},

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) has transformed Bayesian model inference over the past three decades: mainly because of this, Bayesian inference is now a workhorse of applied scientists. Under general conditions, MCMC sampling converges asymptotically to the posterior distribution, but this provides no guarantees about its finite sample performance. The predominant method for monitoring convergence is to run multiple chains and monitor individual chains' characteristics and compare these to the population as a whole: if within-chain and between-chain summaries are comparable, then this is taken to indicate that the chains have converged to a common stationary distribution. Here, we introduce a new method for diagnosing convergence based on whether a machine learning classifier model can successfully discriminate the individual chains. We call this convergence measure \$R\^*\$. In contrast to the predominant \$\textbackslash widehat\{R\}\$, \$R\^*\$ is a single statistic across all parameters that indicates lack of mixing, although individual variables' importance for this metric can also be determined. Additionally, \$R\^*\$ is not based on any single characteristic of the sampling distribution; instead using all the information in the chain, including that given by the joint sampling distribution, which is currently largely overlooked by existing approaches. Since our choice of machine learning classifier, a gradient-boosted regression trees model (GBM), provides uncertainty in predictions, as a byproduct, we obtain uncertainty in \$R\^*\$. The method is straightforward to implement, robust to GBM hyperparameter choice, and could be a complementary additional check on MCMC convergence for applied analyses.},

  abstract = {Multiple imputation (MI) has become a standard statistical technique for dealing with missing values. The CDC Anthrax Vaccine Research Program (AVRP) dataset created new challenges for MI due to the large number of variables of different types and the limited sample size. A common method for imputing missing data in such complex studies is to specify, for each of J variables with missing values, a univariate conditional distribution given all other variables, and then to draw imputations by iterating over the J conditional distributions. Such fully conditional imputation strategies have the theoretical drawback that the conditional distributions may be incompatible. When the missingness pattern is monotone, a theoretically valid approach is to specify, for each variable with missing values, a conditional distribution given the variables with fewer or the same number of missing values and sequentially draw from these distributions. In this article, we propose the “multiple imputation by ordered monotone blocks” approach, which combines these two basic approaches by decomposing any missingness pattern into a collection of smaller “constructed” monotone missingness patterns, and iterating. We apply this strategy to impute the missing data in the AVRP interim data. Supplemental materials, including all source code and a synthetic example dataset, are available online.},

It considers a modification of complete-case analysis that differentially weights the complete cases to adjust for bias. The basic idea is closely related to weighting in randomization inference for finite population surveys. Weighted complete-case estimators are often relatively simple to compute, but the computation of appropriate standard errors, even asymptotically, is less straightforward. Complete-case analysis is potentially wasteful for univariate analyses such as estimation of means and marginal frequency distributions, since values of a particular variable are discarded when they belong to cases that are missing other variables. The analyst wishes to associate a fixed sample size to each base as a check that the tables are correctly defined. The changes in the sample bases in available-case analysis prevent such simple checks.},

The chapter also reviews the use of the sweep operator in linear regression with complete observations and shows how this operator provides a simple and convenient way of performing the maximum likelihood (ML) calculations for incomplete normal data. Finally it discusses a simple alternative approach to adopt a Bayesian perspective and estimate the precision using the posterior variance.},

  abstract = {Standard statistical methods have been developed to analyze rectangular data sets. Traditionally, the rows of the data matrix represent units, also called cases, observations, or subjects depending on context, and the columns represent variables measured for each unit. The entries in the data matrix are nearly always real numbers, either representing the values of essentially continuous variables, such as age and income, or representing categories of response, which may be ordered (e.g., level of education) or unordered . This chapter discusses some important patterns, and formalizes the idea of missing-data mechanisms. A different issue concerns the mechanisms that lead to missing data, and in particular the question of whether the fact that variables are missing is related to the underlying values of the variables in the data set. Missing-data mechanisms are crucial since the properties of missing-data methods depend very strongly on the nature of the dependencies in these mechanisms.},

This chapter considers methods for computing standard errors that do not require computation and inversion of an information matrix. Another method for calculating large-sample covariance matrices involves a two part quadratic approximation to the loglikelihood. This is used to create a normal distribution centered at the ML estimate, and then to draw a set of values θ(d) of θ, concentrated in the region where interest is focused. Although this method assumes large-sample normality, it should be less sensitive to small sample abnormalities close to the ML estimate than methods based directly on the information matrix. Another way of computing precision without inverting an information matrix is to carry out a Bayesian analysis with a uniform prior, and use the posterior variance as the estimate of precision.},

When the families of conditional models are compatible, we provide 20 sufficient conditions under which the imputation distribution converges in total variation to the posterior distribution of a Bayesian model.

  abstract = {Conducting sample surveys, imputing incomplete observations, and analyzing the resulting data are three indispensable phases of modern practice with public-use data files and with many other statistical applications. Each phase inherits different input, including the information preceding it and the intellectual assessments available, and aims to provide output that is one step closer to arriving at statistical inferences with scientific relevance. However, the role of the imputation phase has often been viewed as merely providing computational convenience for users of data. Although facilitating computation is very important, such a viewpoint ignores the imputer's assessments and information inaccessible to the users. This view underlies the recent controversy over the validity of multiple-imputation inference when a procedure for analyzing multiply imputed data sets cannot be derived from (is "uncongenial" to) the model adopted for multiple imputation. Given sensible imputations and complete-data analysis procedures, inferences from standard multiple-imputation combining rules are typically superior to, and thus different from, users' incomplete-data analyses. The latter may suffer from serious nonresponse biases because such analyses often must rely on convenient but unrealistic assumptions about the nonresponse mechanism. When it is desirable to conduct inferences under models for nonresponse other than the original imputation model, a possible alternative to recreating imputations is to incorporate appropriate importance weights into the standard combining rules. These points are reviewed and explored by simple examples and general theory, from both Bayesian and frequentist perspectives, particularly from the randomization perspective. Some convenient terms are suggested for facilitating communication among researchers from different perspectives when evaluating multiple-imputation inferences with uncongenial sources of input.},

While it is widely accepted that valid inferences can be obtained with this technique, these inferences all rely on algorithmic convergence. There is no consensus on how to evaluate the convergence properties of the method. Our study provides insight into identifying non-convergence in iterative imputation algorithms. We found that—in the cases considered—inferential validity was achieved after five to ten iterations, much earlier than indicated by diagnostic methods. We conclude that it never hurts to iterate longer, but such calculations hardly bring added value.},

Several methods have been proposed for creating multiple imputations and most of these methods assume that the data are missing at random (MAR). However, limited diagnostic tools are available to check whether the imputations created by these methods are reasonable. This article develops a set of diagnostic tools based on certain conditional distributions of the observed and imputed values. These conditional distributions should be similar if the assumed model for creating multiple imputations is a good fit. The tools are formulated in terms of numerical summaries and graphical displays and could be easily implemented using the standard complete data software packages. For implementing these methods the exact nature of the model used by the imputer is not needed. The method is illustrated using a data set with large number of variables of different types with varying amount of missing values.},

When making direct-likelihood or Bayesian inferences about θ, it is appropriate to ignore the process that causes missing data if the missing data are missing at random and the parameter of the missing data process is `distinct' from θ.

For this situation and objective, I believe that multiple imputation by the data-base constructor is the method of choice. This article first provides a description of the assumed context and objectives, and second, reviews the multiple imputation framework and its standard results. These preliminary discussions are especially important because some recent commentaries on multiple imputation have reflected either misunderstandings of the practical objectives of multiple imputation or misunderstandings of fundamental theoretical results. Then, criticisms of multiple imputation are considered, and, finally, comparisons are made to alternative strategies.]},

Newer developments are discussed, including some for dealing with missing data that are not MAR.

Until recently, the only missing-data methods available to most data analysts have been relatively ad1 hoc practices such as listwise deletion. Recent dramatic advances in theoretical and computational statistics, however, have produced anew generation of flexible procedures with a sound statistical basis. These procedures involve multiple imputation (Rubin, 1987), a simulation technique that replaces each missing datum with a set of m {$>$} 1 plausible values. The rn versions of the complete data are analyzed by standard complete-data methods, and the results are combined using simple rules to yield estimates, standard errors, and p-values that formally incorporate missing-data uncertainty. New computational algorithms and software described in a recent book (Schafer, 1997a) allow us to create proper multiple imputations in complex multivariate settings. This article reviews the key ideas of multiple imputation, discusses the software programs currently available, and demonstrates their use on data from the Adolescent Alcohol Prevention Trial (Hansen \& Graham, 199 I).},

In the literature, multiple imputation is known to be the standard method to handle missing data. While the theory of multiple imputation has been known for decades, the implementation is difficult due to the complicated nature of random draws from the posterior distribution. Thus, there are several computational algorithms in software: Data Augmentation (DA), Fully Conditional Specification (FCS), and Expectation-Maximization with Bootstrapping (EMB). Although the literature is full of comparisons between joint modeling (DA, EMB) and conditional modeling (FCS), little is known about the relative superiority between the MCMC algorithms (DA, FCS) and the non-MCMC algorithm (EMB), where MCMC stands for Markov chain Monte Carlo. Based on simulation experiments, the current study contends that EMB is a confidence proper (confidence-supporting) multiple imputation algorithm without between-imputation iterations; thus, EMB is more user-friendly than DA and FCS.},

  abstract = {This paper studies a non-response problem in survival analysis where the occurrence of missing data in the risk factor is related to mortality. In a study to determine the influence of blood pressure on survival in the very old (85+ years), blood pressure measurements are missing in about 12.5 per cent of the sample. The available data suggest that the process that created the missing data depends jointly on survival and the unknown blood pressure, thereby distorting the relation of interest. Multiple imputation is used to impute missing blood pressure and then analyse the data under a variety of non-response models. One special modelling problem is treated in detail; the construction of a predictive model for drawing imputations if the number of variables is large. Risk estimates for these data appear robust to even large departures from the simplest non-response model, and are similar to those derived under deletion of the incomplete records.},

  abstract = {Whenever statistical analyses are applied to multiply imputed datasets, specific formulas are needed to combine the results into one overall analysis, also called combination rules. In the context of regression analysis, combination rules for the unstandardized regression coefficients, the t-tests of the regression coefficients, and the F-tests for testing \$\$R\^\{2\}\$\$R2 for significance have long been established. However, there is still no general agreement on how to combine the point estimators of \$\$R\^\{2\}\$\$R2 in multiple regression applied to multiply imputed datasets. Additionally, no combination rules for standardized regression coefficients and their confidence intervals seem to have been developed at all. In the current article, two sets of combination rules for the standardized regression coefficients and their confidence intervals are proposed, and their statistical properties are discussed. Additionally, two improved point estimators of \$\$R\^\{2\}\$\$R2 in multiply imputed data are proposed, which in their computation use the pooled standardized regression coefficients. Simulations show that the proposed pooled standardized coefficients produce only small bias and that their 95\% confidence intervals produce coverage close to the theoretical 95\%. Furthermore, the simulations show that the newly proposed pooled estimates for \$\$R\^\{2\}\$\$R2 are less biased than two earlier proposed pooled estimates.},

  abstract = {Gelman and Rubin's (1992) convergence diagnostic is one of the most popular methods for terminating a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler. Since the seminal paper, researchers have developed sophisticated methods of variance estimation for Monte Carlo averages. We show that this class of estimators find immediate use in the Gelman-Rubin statistic, a connection not established in the literature before. We incorporate these estimators to upgrade both the univariate and multivariate Gelman-Rubin statistics, leading to increased stability in MCMC termination time. An immediate advantage is that our new Gelman-Rubin statistic can be calculated for a single chain. In addition, we establish a relationship between the Gelman-Rubin statistic and effective sample size. Leveraging this relationship, we develop a principled cutoff criterion for the Gelman-Rubin statistic. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our improved diagnostic via examples.},

  abstract = {Current pooling rules for multiply imputed data assume infinite populations. In some situations this assumption is not feasible as every unit in the population has been observed, potentially leading to over-covered population estimates. We simplify the existing pooling rules for situations where the sampling variance is not of interest. We compare these rules to the conventional pooling rules and demonstrate their use in a situation where there is no sampling variance. Using the standard pooling rules in situations where sampling variance should not be considered, leads to overestimation of the variance of the estimates of interest, especially when the amount of missingness is not very large. As a result, populations estimates are over-covered, which may lead to a loss of statistical power. We conclude that the theory of multiple imputation can be extended to the situation where the sample happens to be the population. The simplified pooling rules can be easily implemented to obtain valid inference in cases where we have observed essentially all units and in simulation studies addressing the missingness mechanism only.},

Study Design and Setting We conducted a systematic survey of RCTs published in 2014 in the core clinical journals that reported at least one patient-important outcome analyzed as a continuous variable. Results Among 200 studies, 187 (93.5\%) trials explicitly reported whether MPD occurred. In the 163 (81.5\%) trials that reported the occurrence of MPD, the median and interquartile ranges of the percentage of participants with MPD were 11.4\% (2.5\%–22.6\%).Among the 147 trials in which authors made clear their analytical approach to MPD, the approaches chosen included available data only (109, 67\%); mixed-effect models (10, 6.1\%); multiple imputation (9, 4.5\%); and last observation carried forward (9, 4.5). Of the 163 studies reporting MPD, 16 (9.8\%) conducted sensitivity analyses examining the impact of the MPD and (18, 11.1\%) discussed the risk of bias associated with MPD. Conclusion RCTs reporting continuous outcomes typically have over 10\% of participant data missing. Most RCTs failed to use optimal analytic methods, and very few conducted sensitivity analyses addressing the possible impact of MPD or commented on how MPD might influence risk of bias.},

  abstract = {A sequential regression or chained equations imputation approach uses a Gibbs sampling-type iterative algorithm that imputes the missing values using a sequence of conditional regression models. It is a flexible approach for handling different types of variables and complex data structures. Many simulation studies have shown that the multiple imputation inferences based on this procedure have desirable repeated sampling properties. However, a theoretical weakness of this approach is that the specification of a set of conditional regression models may not be compatible with a joint distribution of the variables being imputed. Hence, the convergence properties of the iterative algorithm are not well understood. This article develops conditions for convergence and assesses the properties of inferences from both compatible and incompatible sequence of regression models. The results are established for the missing data pattern where each subject may be missing a value on at most one variable. The sequence of regression models are assumed to be empirically good fit for the data chosen by the imputer based on appropriate model diagnostics. The results are used to develop criteria for the choice of regression models. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},
